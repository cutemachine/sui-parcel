# SUI-Parcel

Launch your own React projects in no time with SUI-Parcel.

This is a basic React app which includes some [Semantic-UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction) components.


## Technologies Used

- [Babel—Next generation JavaScript](https://babeljs.io)
- [React—A JavaScript library for building user interfaces](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Semantic-UI React—The official Semantic-UI-React integration](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction)
- [Parcel—Blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler](https://parceljs.org)
- [Semantic-UI-Forest—Collection of design, themes and templates for Semantic-UI](http://semantic-ui-forest.com/)


## Getting Started

Just clone the project. Remove the old Git history. Then install the dependencies with `yarn`. When the installation has finished you can run the new app with `yarn start`. These are the steps in more detail:

    git clone https://github.com/cutemachine/sui-parcel.git
    cd sui-parcel
    rm -rf .git
    yarn
    yarn start

When the dev server started you can point your broswer to the URL given in the Terminal. Normally this is [localhost:1234](http:localhost:1234).


## Build

You can build the project with the `parcel` command. You can also use the NPM script set up in the `package.json` file.

    yarn build
